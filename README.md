# UI-Router Marionette

An attempt at writing a UI-Router integration for Backbone Marionette apps. Not yet functional.

## Running the example:
```
# npm install -g brunch
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Accessible at `http://localhost:3332`.

Doesn't set up default routes or anything yet so currently you need to open the javascript console and run `App.router.stateService.go('app.client.contact', {id: 4})`

## Current issues:
- Everything!
- Duplicates the "Root component" view.
